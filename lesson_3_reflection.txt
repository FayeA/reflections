When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - I would want to use a remote repository if I want to collaborate with others
    or if I want to save my work in a remote location so that I could access
    it from elsewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Because it can get confusing the code is updated before I have completed my
    modifications. Also, my code might not work properly if the code is updated
    with the "master changes".
    - Also, it's possible that the changes would not be merged anyway, because
    there will likely be merge conflicts that need to be resolved manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone - this is a copy of a repository, including all the files and the entire
    history

    Fork - this is a github feature. This is a clone of another user's repository,
    but with the added feature of tracking the clones and linking to the user who
    initially created the repository

    Branch - branches have the same parent commits, but moving forward the changes
    between the branches will be different. Branches can be merged so that the changes
    can be combined. Branches are used for experimental changes, for new versions, and
    for collaboration.
