When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - I would want to use a remote repository if I want to collaborate with others
    or if I want to save my work in a remote location so that I could access
    it from elsewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Because it can get confusing the code is updated before I have completed my
    modifications. Also, my code might not work properly if the code is updated
    with the "master changes".
    - Also, it's possible that the changes would not be merged anyway, because
    there will likely be merge conflicts that need to be resolved manually.
